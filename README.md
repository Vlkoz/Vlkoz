## About me
I handle full-cycle analysis, from pre-processing raw data in Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, SciPy) to building auto-updated Tableau dashboards for business purposes. I am also highly proficient in Excel/GoogleSheets.

I use SQL to retrieve the necessary data (GROUP BY, HAVING, JOIN, CASE WHEN, window functions, CTE, etc.). I analyse A/B test results and also run A/A tests to verify split system quality.

I use chi-square and Bootstrap (for detailed analyses) to find statistically significant differences in group distributions.

I like to solve non-standard tasks and automate routine tasks. I am personally inspired when the results of my work can be positively expressed in the dynamics of
the targeted business metrics.

In my free time, I also dedicate my time to the development of product analytics. I Successfully completed a "Karpov Courses‚Äù training with the specialization on Data
Analytics.
