### About me
I am engaged in full-cycle analysis from preprocessing raw data using Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy) to building auto-updated dashboards in Tableau for business units.
I use some SQL-dialects to get aggregated data as a base of any research (GROUP BY, HAVING, JOIN, CASE WHEN, window functions, CTE etc). Broadest experience in writing queries I have in Ckickhouse and Postgres.
I can analyze results of A/B-test, do an A/A-test to check the quality of the splitter and use both Chi-square and bootstrap (for more detail) to find statistically significant differences in groups distribution.
In my opinion, non-standard tasks provide the opportunity to get any interesting case for my working background. Also I know how to automate standard tasks to free up working time for more promising researches in the future. I am inspired when the results of my work can be expressed in the positive dynamics of business target metrics.
I devote my free time to self-education in product analytics. I have successfully completed specialization «Data Analyst» in data science school «Karpov Courses».
